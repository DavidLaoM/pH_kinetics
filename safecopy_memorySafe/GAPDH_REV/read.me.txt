- In the kinetic experiments there are different time window for the measurements (time btwn reads varies: each 12 or 4 seconds)
- [protein]=2.0106363826145692 mg/ml
- number of pH testes: 10
- pH tested: 6.19, 6.26, 6.41, 6.60, 6.81, 7.06, 7.29, 7.51, 7.68, 7.81
- Kinetic assays measure: NADH decay
- To convert abs to NADH decay (um.min-1.mgprotein-1): abs*60*60/(total_protein*4.3992)
In this formula it's already included the dilution of the cell extract in the reaction volume --> 300ul/5ul=60
- For the background correction: the background was measured before the addition of the start chemical.
Calculate the background rates and subtract to the rates after adition of substrate. The small decrease in the abs
observed in for the background is due to oxidation.
